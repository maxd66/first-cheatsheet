small cheatsheet of cool css tricks

## Description

This coding cheatsheet was a website made to practice my skills with css. It has snippets of code, formatted properly to be copied and pasted into your css file. It is still a work in progress, and I might only stop adding to it if I make a sequel. I would like to give a huge shoutout to Vivianna Cowen and Israel Magallon. They both helped me create this page. 

## Installation and Usage

There is no installation required.

## Credits

Again Vivianna Cowen and Israel Magallon were on my team for the creation of this website.
